# Snowflake Mirroring in Microsoft Fabric

This workshop demonstrates how to mirror a **custom IoT dataset** from Snowflake into Microsoft Fabric and validate it through SQL Endpoints.

## üìù Overview
Snowflake Mirroring allows Fabric to read Snowflake data continuously, enabling near real-time analytics in Fabric without building pipelines.

**When to use:**
Mirroring is ideal when you need to keep Fabric in sync with Snowflake without manually copying data or scheduling batch jobs. It works similarly to CDC (Change Data Capture) ‚Äî tracking changes in Snowflake and streaming them into Fabric ‚Äî so your analytics stay up to date with minimal latency. This is particularly useful for scenarios like IoT telemetry, financial transactions, or any workload where fresh data is critical for decision-making.

Below the architecture reference for the Database Mirroring:

**What you will learn:**
- Preparing a Snowflake environment (database + sample data)
- Creating a Fabric mirrored database
- Querying mirrored tables in Fabric

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- A Snowflake account with access to create databases/tables
- A Microsoft Fabric workspace with Contributor permissions
- Power BI or Fabric SQL Endpoint enabled

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Notes

- **Networking & Security:** If Snowflake is private, configure a VNet Data Gateway or On-premises Data Gateway. [Learn more](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-factory/securely-connect-to-data)
- **Monitoring:** Use the Fabric Mirroring UI to check sync latency. [Details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/monitoring)
- **Cost & Limits:** Review [official limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/snowflake#considerations)
- **Troubleshooting:** See [guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/mirroring/troubleshooting)
