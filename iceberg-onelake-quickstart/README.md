# Getting Started with Iceberg in OneLake (Workshop)

This workshop guides you through creating an **Iceberg table backed by Microsoft OneLake**, then **querying it from both Snowflake and Fabric**.

# Benefits

- **Iceberg tables on OneLake** means that the Snowflake platform will be able to write Iceberg tables on OneLake.
- All data stored in OneLake will be accessible by Snowflake compute and services
- Snowflake data can be seamlessly integrated with Microsoft tools
- All data from OneLake can be extended to Snowflake for cross-cloud AI, applications, sharing and collaboration, and advanced analytics, among many other workloads
