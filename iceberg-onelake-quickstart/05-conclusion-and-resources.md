# 5. Conclusion and Resources

You created:
- A **Snowflake External Volume** targeting your **OneLake** path.
- An **Iceberg table** (`DIM_CUSTOMER`) physically stored in OneLake.
- A **Fabric Table Shortcut** to read the same table from a **Lakehouse**.

## Next steps
- Try larger datasets and evolve the schema.
- Build a Power BI semantic model on top of the Lakehouse table.
- Build a Fabric Data Agent and ground the agent with the Iceberg table data.
- Explore writing from Fabric back into Iceberg and reading in Snowflake.
